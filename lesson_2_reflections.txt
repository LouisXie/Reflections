When a repository is initialized, a file named ".git"
will be created in the same directory. After that, you
can do commits and record the history of your files.

Because only after you initializd a repository, can 
the directory be a repository rather than a ordinary
directory.


Working directory is some directory that you are doing
work with, while the repository is a git version directory
of your working directory. In between of these two 
directories comes the staging area, which bridges the 
gap between the working directory and the repository.


Before doing any commit, you can just check the difference
between the staging area and the repository to see if
there is only one different file. If yes, then you can 
make sure that you have one commit per logical change.
