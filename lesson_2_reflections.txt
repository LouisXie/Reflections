When a repository is initialized, a file named ".git"
will be created in the same directory. After that, you
can do commits and record the history of your files.

Because only after you initializd a repository, can 
the directory be a repository rather than a ordinary
directory.


Working directory is some directory that you are doing
work with, while the repository is a git version directory
of your working directory. In between of these two 
directories comes the staging area, which bridges the 
gap between the working directory and the repository.


Before doing any commit, you can just check the difference
between the staging area and the repository to see if
there is only one different file. If yes, then you can 
make sure that you have one commit per logical change.


When you want to do some experiments on your files but
also want to keep the original files as is, because
you are not sure if the experiments are going to work
or if you really want these new features. At these
times, you can get a branch of your master branch and
just do these experiments on you new branch.


The diagrams list all the commits in all the branches,
which makes the whole history visualilzable and clear.


After merging two branches, you will only get one branch
left. And the branch left is the branch now checked out.


Pros: Automatic merging will help you do the routine and
time-consuming work and save a lot of time. But sometimes,
automatic merging will come across some conflicts coming
from the two different branches, and here comes the mannually
merging.

Cons: I cannot think of the cons of automatic merging.
