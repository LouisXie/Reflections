When a repository is initialized, a file named ".git"
will be created in the same directory. After that, you
can do commits and record the history of your files.

Because only after you initializd a repository, can 
the directory be a repository rather than a ordinary
directory.


Working directory is some directory that you are doing
work with, while the repository is a git version directory
of your working directory. In between of these two 
directories comes the staging area, which bridges the 
gap between the working directory and the repository.
