When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    At the times when I have no git installed locally or I just want to do commits in a remote repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because the remote repositories on GitHub are public and everyone has access to them. If the remote repos automatically stay up-to-date with my local commits, then something with bugs or unfulfilled may be published and induce something bad.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are the copy-version of some repos which will only appear on you own GitHub profile.
	Clones are some local repos which clone from remote repos or some local repos in a different location.
	Branches are different version of your repos which are related to the master branch.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	In this case, you can decide to keep which one when there are changes both remotely and locally.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	I will use email or some cloud-based service, like dropbox and Google drive. Also I can use Google docs. But certainly, without Git or GitHub, collaboration with other methods will be a little harder.
