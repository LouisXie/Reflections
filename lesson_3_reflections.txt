When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    At the times when I have no git installed locally or I just want to do commits in a remote repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because the remote repositories on GitHub are public and everyone has access to them. If the remote repos automatically stay up-to-date with my local commits, then something with bugs or unfulfilled may be published and induce something bad.
